## Personal life
My name is Kaiwen Zhang, 张楷文 in Chinese, a lucky guy who just got married! I am a typical night owl (of course I am as an astronomer). 
I love trying different things to find the meaning for my life. My sister is a cat named 'like flower', 如花 in Chinese. She's cute!

## After work hobby
[Photography](https://github.com/poole/hyde) (including Astrophotograph), hiking, traveling, basketball, gaming and [mountain biking](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
