Changing-look AGNs are fascinating objects characterized by substantial spectral changes over time (timescale range from months to decades). 
These changes can manifest as hardening or softening in the X-ray spectrum, or the vanishing or emergence of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum.

There are two types of changing-look AGNs:
- Changing obscuration, which is caused by outflowing clouds or the dusty torus temporarily obscuring the central ionizing source. These events lead to variability in the observed spectrum as the obscuration changes, usually in the X-ray.
- Changing state, which is driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion flow, such as fluctuations in the accretion rate. It may also involve the destruction or recovery of the BLR.

Using WIRO data, I aim to identify the fastest changing obscuration events, often referred to as AGN blinks. 
These rapid events offer a unique opportunity to study the dynamic interplay between the obscuring material, such as the torus or outflows, and the central engine of AGNs. 
By detecting and analyzing these phenomena, we can gain a deeper understanding of the AGN structure, helping to refine the AGN unified model.
