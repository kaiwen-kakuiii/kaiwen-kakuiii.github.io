Reverberation mapping is a powerful technique used to measure the physical scale of structures inside an AGN. 
It leverages the concept of light echoes: the time-delayed response of broad emission line (BLR) regions to variations in the central sourceâ€™s flux.

In MAHA project, we calculate the cross correlation function for the light curve of broad Hb and 5100A continuum. 
The cross correlation function provides the time delay between the variations in the continuum and the BLR, thus determine physical scale of the BLR.
We also use velocity resolved emission line profile to construct the velocity delay map (VDM). These maps offer crucial insights into the geometry and kinematics of the BLR 
(e.g., whether the BLR exhibits rotational, inflowing, or outflowing motion).

In my research, I adopt the dynamical modeling approach to study BLR in AGN. This method employs diffusive nested sampling and MCMC techniques to construct a physically realistic three-dimensional model of the BLR.
Thus, I am able to constrain key parameters such as: BH mass, BLR geometry and kinematic properties.
